Success
Song by Interpol


Dreams of long life
What safety can you find
See the great unknown
That shade for miles

Good eye
I'm the good guy

Dreams of long life
What safety can you find
If the sea was that strong
Maybe we had, maybe we had to fly

Was a good try
I'm a good guy

As high as the day
I read the papers
Before crime will pay
I'll learn to bury most beliefs
